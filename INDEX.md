What?!  WHY AM I LOOKING AT A MARKDOWN FILE?!

_ahem_

You might be looking for the __[github page](https://github.com/mschnee/)__, the __[resume](https://github.com/mschnee/mschnee.github.io/blob/master/RESUME.md)__, or the abbreviated __[portfolio](https://github.com/mschnee/mschnee.github.io/blob/master/PORTFOLIO.md)__.

__Or maybe you should put a real website here!__

Such things may be true.

__I was expecting more stuff on your GitHub, or more contributions from your account__

Over the last 8 years, I've worked for a number of organizations with extremely strict policies concerning personal projects, and ownership of IP.  This is normal.
